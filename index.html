									<!-- <h3>SEC Hopes to Make Succession Plans Mandatory for Financial Advisors</h3>
									<hr>
									<p>The SEC wants to make succession plans a requirement, and it could happen sooner than you think. This past December, SEC Chairman Mary Jo White said, “[We are] developing a recommendation to require investment advisers to create transition plans to prepare for a major disruption in their business” (<a href="http://www.sec.gov/News/Speech/Detail/Speech/1370543677722#.VPTRnFPF_U5">sec.gov</a>). This transition (succession) rule is on the SEC’s regulatory calendar for proposal in October. Read the original article for more details here: Investment News</p> -->

										<h3>Protect Your Clients</h3>
										<p>Currently, less than 4% of advisors have a written, enforceable continuity plan.* Do you have a plan in place? What happens to your clients if something happens to you?</p>

										<h3>Advisor Experience</h3>
									<p><i>I completed a succession plan with First Western Advisors years before my retirement. I’m still working as an independent advisor...I’ve been telling clients for years to get their life planning done, and now, I’ve finally done mine. I feel so much better knowing the transition for my business is complete.</i></p>
									<h5 style="text-align:right;">&ndash;Donald B. Baxter</h5>
									<br>
									<p><i>I’ve been very pleased with the professionalism and concern that First Western Advisors has shown to me and my family…My biggest concern was not being fairly compensated for my lifetime of work, but First Western Advisors provided a very workable solution. </i></p>
									<h5 style="text-align:right;">&ndash;Stewart T. Simons</h5>
									<hr>
									
										
										<h3>We Got You Covered</h3>

										<p>Transitioning is not a problem. We work with two of the most popular platforms available: Charles Schwab &amp; NFS/Fidelity. 
										<br>
										<p>We also offer full back-office functionality and support (including client transition support).</p>
